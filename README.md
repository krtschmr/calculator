## The one and only Monero mining calculator
Monero is special. The emission curve makes sure that each new block have less blockreward. No mining calculator is considering this. If you use them, they'll lead you to wrong expectations.

This calculator uses the following formula:

    Blockreward = (2^64 - 1 - current_supply * 10^12) * 2^-19 * 10^-12
    Daily income estimate = (H/s * Blockreward * 720) / NetworkHashrate
*Do not use any other calculator - they lead to wrong results. You have been warned!*
